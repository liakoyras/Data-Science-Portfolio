# Kaggle Competitions

In this folder there are notebooks containing the code I used to participate in some Kaggle competirions. 
The data for each competition can be downloaded from the Kaggle links provided.

## Disclaimer:
Most of the code presented here is taken from Kaggle kernels relevant to each competition. I try to always link to all of them inside the notebook.
I do not claim ownership of said code.

Below it is a summary of them.
