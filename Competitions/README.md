# Kaggle Competitions

In this folder there are notebooks containing the code I used to participate in some Kaggle competirions. 
The data for each competition can be downloaded from the Kaggle links provided.

## Disclaimer:
Most of the code presented here is taken from Kaggle kernels relevant to each competition. I try to always link to all of them inside the notebook.<br>
I do not claim ownership of said code.

Below it is a summary of them.

## :ship: Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster
This is a classic [competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic), ideal for beginners.<br>
The code is from back when I first got involved with Data Science and I wrote it in order to follow a tutorial, so it is very unsofisticated but I could not resist the nostalgia to upload it.<br>
I might come back to better my score.

## :skull: Microsoft Malware Prediction
This was a very popular [competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/microsoft-malware-prediction) with a huge dataset, proving itself challenging even for simple things like loading all of the data or encoding the categorical variables.<br>
The lessons and techniques learned from this regarding memory management and careful resource allocation will prove themselves invaluable.
